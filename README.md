# iris-classification
## Overview
This repository contains code for building a classification model on the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target label (species of iris).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found here'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris'. It has been preprocessed to remove the 'ID' column.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

## Models Implemented
Logistic Regression
K-nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree

## Evaluation
The accuracy of each model is printed after training and testing. Additionally, further evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can be implemented and added to the script.

## Acknowledgements
The Iris dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Inspiration for this project comes from various tutorials and resources available online.
